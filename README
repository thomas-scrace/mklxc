# What is it?

Quick script to set up lxc containers.

The purpose of this is to be able to quickly throw up
containers for use as throwaway contained development boxes. Not
intended for use in any production systems.

Takes care of a few fiddly things like configuring shared
directories and ssh keys.

Usage:
    ./mklxc container-name /path/to/dir /path/to/otherdir

container-name will be created with the shared dirs at

    /home/ubuntu/dir
    /home/ubuntu/otherdir

A known limitation is that you can't share multiple directories
with the same basename. This is because I have no need to do this.

Minimally tested.

#Requirements

It runs on Ubuntu. It's intended for creating ubuntu boxes.

The following packages are required for lxc support:

    lxc lxctl lxc-templates

And for bootstrapping ssh access:

    sshpass
